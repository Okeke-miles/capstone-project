As Adam makes his politically-incorrect climb up the ranks, he risks alienating his father, a renowned writer and tenured professor at Adam's university, along with his skeptical girlfriend Maya, and all of his academic friends. His success breeds outrage however; Adam soon faces growing backlash on campus and comes to understand the importance (and cost) of free speech.",

If a person lives their anti-fragile faith in every environment, one can experience the joy that thrives in any environment. Fr. Michael Schmitz is the director of youth and young adult ministry for the Diocese of Duluth and chaplain for the Newman Center at the University of Minnesota-Duluth.
